# Cosentus Landing Page - Development Notes

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js landing page for Cosentus Medical RCM with an integrated AI chat widget.

## Key Features
- Baby blue, white, and gray color scheme
- Expandable chat widget with Cosentus AI integration
- Fully responsive design
- Ready for Vercel deployment

## Chat Widget Integration
- Uses Cosentus Voice SDK (loaded from https://cosentusai.vercel.app/cosentus-voice.js)
- Chat assistant is initialized via `CosentusVoice.createChatAssistant()`
- Event-driven architecture for messages, loading states, and errors
- No backend needed - SDK handles all API communication

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Run production build locally

## Deployment
- Push to Git repository
- Connect to Vercel
- Deploy automatically (see DEPLOYMENT.md for details)

## File Structure
- `/app/page.tsx` - Main landing page
- `/app/components/ChatWidget.tsx` - AI chat widget component
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with SDK script
- `/app/globals.css` & `/app/page.module.css` - Styling

## Notes
- SDK loads asynchronously, component handles initialization
- Chat expands on first message
- Loading indicator shows while AI is responding
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
